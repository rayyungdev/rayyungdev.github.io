&lt;p&gt;Alright, I am officially FINISHED with my first model. There’s a lot of improvements to be made, but let me tell you my process.
First, I had to understand what my goal and objective, but you can read about that in my previous blog post, link [&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;]{&lt;a href=&quot;https://rayyungdev.github.io/blogs/bot-builder/%7D&quot;&gt;https://rayyungdev.github.io/blogs/bot-builder/}&lt;/a&gt;. Once I figured out that I wanted to an intent classification model, I had to learn about how those models were built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I wanted to replicate a paper, that claimed that CBoW-SVM learning model that uses fasttext embeddings. Unfortunately, I was not able to successfully implement that since I couldn’t understand how to implemement CBoW with fasttext. After giving up on that, I found a model through kaggle, that I’ll link &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/code/hassanamin/atis-intent-classification-using-svm-and-spacy/notebook&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, before I tell you about that though, let me tell you about the dataset. Did you know that an interview question dataset that does not exist? Yea! Even though there’s a bunch of interview prep guides out there, an interview question dataset does not yet exist. So I had to build on myself! I went through a couple of interview prep guides, looked through their question and judged their intent. I came out with like 150 questions, with a lot of repetition. Of those 150 questions, I had 30 labeled intentions. I know that’s not a lot of questions, but once I have the bot running I plan on having people use it and also build upon that dataset. It’s not much, but it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the model, the original model from Kaggle uses an SVC model, but I found that I got better results using an SGD model. Of course, this might just be because of how small my dataset it, but yea, please help me build onto this dataset!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I’m getting ahead of myself. The next step now, is to implmement a chatbot that you can use on my site. It’ll probably mean that I have to have a server running somewhere to keep my python model running… but we’ll see when we get there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sneakpeak of my model working:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; Original HTML template &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see with my blog here, it’s pretty similar. I made some changes to the CSS to make the articles wider and I removed some features/links that I thought was unnecessary, like the “blog detail” and “blog grid”. After I made these adjustments, rayyungdev.github.io v0.0.01 was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Moving to Gatsby &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had no idea how to write javascript, let alone react/gatsby, so it was a bit of a struggle. But I soon understood the pattern between my html template and other codes that I was looking at and the conversion was pretty self explanatory, like changing &lt;strong&gt;HTML’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;react’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div className&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  Again, I’m still new to react and web-development in general so I’m sure I’m not making the most out of gatsby yet, but hey at least I’m starting something, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I still didn’t understand components, plugins, etc, I did know what kind of features I wanted in my site. I knew I wanted to be able to scroll down infinitely on the home page to see my blog history. I also knew that I wanted featured-pictures from my blog posts to populate my homepage. I tried to figure out how to learn all of this by watching a Gatsby Tutorial on youtube that was 9 hours long, but I called it quits after 40 minutes. Don’t get me wrong, it was helpful, but just did not have the patience. Instead, I looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/&quot;&gt;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/&lt;/a&gt; and found the templates that had the features I wanted and tried to implement them the same way, which led me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/&quot;&gt;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had discussed some changes in my blogpost, but given that this is my project section, this is I did specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Components:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navbar
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I removed some things from the original navbar because I just didn’t see the point. I might throw in the page button again, but until I have like 5 posts, I just don’t see it being necessary just yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Pages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is for ongoing projects, but I have 3 different routes that I’m still working on:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specifically for my blog post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specifically for my projects (like this), although I really only put this here so I would have a reason for my banner/carousel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interview
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honestly, not necesarry but this will be changed up later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My goal for this section later is to designate specific templates depending on some things…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey started because I suck at interviews. I find myself in a spiral of anxiety and imposter syndrome as I continously bomb my interviews.
One weird quirk about me, is that although I feel humiliated, I feel even more motivated now to do something creative so that I can still prove to myself that I am a qualified “developer”.
So anyway, I just bombed an interview and it has reaffirmed my distaste for them. I am now reminded again of something that I originally wanted to do: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;create a chatbot to do the interview for me!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of my idea comes from the believe that interviewers usually ask the same set of questions like, &lt;em&gt;“Tell me about yourself”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“How do you act in high pressure situations”&lt;/em&gt;. There might be variations of this, but they all expect similar responses. So ya know… like &lt;strong&gt;“Frequently Asked Questions”&lt;/strong&gt;. The original plan was going to just have a list of these questions and my answer to them in markdown, like my blogs. But you see, I don’t want to do that because it takes away time from me actually working on the bot that I definitely want to have, so I’m skipping this step. I still have my list of questions and answers, but I’m not going to post it &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-italic font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Getting Started &lt;hr color=&quot;blue&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto auto auto&quot;&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;div class = &apos;font-italic justify-content-center&apos; style=&quot;display:flex&quot;&gt; &lt;small class = &quot;font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; The purpose of this section is to organize my own thoughts on how I plan to go about this project. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I can think about this project as two main parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building the NLP Model for the bot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing a chat feature in my site for users to interact with the bot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for now, let’s think about what building the model will take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out what model I will be using&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather the data to train my model on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I figure out what model I’m going to use, I’ll need to train it.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will involve preprocessing the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally thought I could create my own dataset where I would create my own answers for the FAQ’s, but as I continued to working on it, but that led me down a path to nowhere as I didn’t even have a model in mind. I had to do… &lt;em&gt;research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-italic font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; The Research &lt;hr color=&quot;blue&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto auto auto&quot;&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was first tried looking for an appropriate model, I thought I could use a question-answering model. I figured it was going to be straightforward given the name, that it could be trained if the model was given a enough questions and answers. But alas, this was not the case. It turns out the model is trained to understand contextual questions to identify necessary information in an article, which is not my goal at all… So back to the drawing board!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of going into that direction, I decided to look into how chatbots work. They definitely use some sort of machine learning algorithm, right?  Well I stumbled upon this &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/models-for-conversational-ai-34312fe1f6d9&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; written by Srini Janarthanam. Here, Srini discusses 5 possible Conversational AI classes:   &lt;em&gt;Interactive FAQ, Form Filling, Question Answering, NL interface for Databases, and Dialogue Planning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you catch that? &lt;strong&gt;Interactive FAQ!&lt;/strong&gt; Is this what I needed to look into the whole time? I’ve gotten my hopes up once before, only for it to be torn asunder. So let’s keep reading…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) are usually a common part of business websites where all the frequently asked questions for customers are listed and answered. Instead of having customers go through the list and find answers to their questions, &lt;strong&gt;Interactive FAQ model for chatbots allows users to ask questions in their own way, match customer question to the list of questions and then serve the prepared answer for the matched question.&lt;/strong&gt; This process enables customers to find answers quickly instead of having to go through a long list of questions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/models-for-conversational-ai-34312fe1f6d9&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--- Article by Srini Janarthanam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This… this might be it! Think about it, I’m assuming that different interviewers are asking same question with some variation. While the questions might be diferent, the prepared answer will be the same. &lt;strong&gt;Awesome!&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Srini then discusses models that exist in this field, Single-vs-Multi turn, Intent-vs-Pattern Recognition, User-utterance, and Deeplearning seq2seq models. I’m not going to go through it all because I recommend that you read his article. Instead, I’m going to discuss which models seem the most releveant to my case and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intent-vs-Pattern-Recognition / Intent Classification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea was to train a model by answering a lot of interview questions with the understanding that some answer to these questions are going to be the same, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do you want to work at this company?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Why do you want this job?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer would be the same for both:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I need money and you guys seem awesome”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this model works by mapping &lt;strong&gt;questions with answers&lt;/strong&gt; to an &lt;strong&gt;intent&lt;/strong&gt;. So my previous example would be 1 intent with 2 datapoints (questions) associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the model is to &lt;strong&gt;learn how to classify a new unseen question from a future interviewer as one of the intents&lt;/strong&gt;, as Srini succintly puts it, &lt;em&gt;Once an intent is identified, the answer can be served&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seq2Seq Single-Turn FAQ Model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly I’m not compleltely confident that this model is applicable. seq2seq is a deep learning model and from my understanding of it, it will A LOT of data. You see it a lot with chatbots because the goal of a chatbot is to accept an input as a text and regurgitates a text back. If we want to get into more detail, the sentence is encoded into value, math is done to the value to take context into account, then the calculations are fed into a decoder which is the chatbot’s response. In my case, I don’t really know how I can implement it. And as I’m looking more into seq2seq models, it seems like it requires a large dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m keeping this on here because it might be something I look into later…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/bff6ca93a35d7b0e6ed89f4a817db0eb/spongebob-dance.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; We&apos;re getting somewhere!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-italic font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Gathering Data &lt;hr color=&quot;blue&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto auto auto&quot;&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;div class = &apos;font-italic justify-content-center&apos; style=&quot;display:flex&quot;&gt; &lt;small class = &quot;font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; In this section, I&apos;m going to look into the specifics of the model so I can create a suitable dataset for it&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I’m pretty set on using intent classification to create my chatbot. So now let’s think about the data. (There won’t be any code for this post, just a lot of brainstorming the code will in my project section because ya know I have to have something there at some point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine that the data would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Intent&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Question&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Why do you want to work at this company?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I need money and you guys seem awesome&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Why do you want this job?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I need money and you guys seem awesome&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Tell me about yourself&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I have a lot of IT experience and I hope to break out in the development world&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Walk me through your resume&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I have a lot of IT experience and I hope to break out in the development world&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now going through all of this, how should I go around gathering my data? So this is probably going to suck because I think going to have to do this manually. Remember, my theory is that there are limited answers to interview questions (&lt;em&gt;unless they ask me techinical questions…&lt;/em&gt;). Once I gather the questions, I’m going to have to group them myself and give each group a unique value that represents intent. Finally, I’ll go through all the intents, pull a random question from it, then finally answer that question. That answer will be my response for the questions in that group. Hopefully, this isn’t going to be that bad.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MVP Gatsby Website Finally Complete!]]></title><description><![CDATA[In case you don’t have the patience to watch the 44 second clip, Lewis suggests that the best first programming project should be a blog…]]></description><link>null/blogs/gatsby-migration/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">null/blogs/gatsby-migration/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;div classname=&quot;justify-content-center&quot;&gt;
    Alright, so this is my official SECOND post for my blog. A lot of work has been done and let me tell you all about it!  It might seem like that I haven&apos;t really changed the site at all, but really I have made a whole migration from my old bootstrap html template to a gatsby, a static-site-generator and man was it a pain in the ass. So first... let me tell you why I did this in the first place. I started my blog back in June because of a youtube channel called &quot;Coding with Lewis&quot;. I&apos;m going to attach the video here: 
    &lt;figure align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;70%&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jm5s6N0R0pM&quot; title=&quot;This is the best first project for programmers 👩‍💻 #technology #programming #software #career&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; The Best First Project for Programmers, Coding with Lewis &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don’t have the patience to watch the 44 second clip, Lewis suggests that the best first programming project should be a blog. Not only that, but he also suggests using the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host the blog for free (in my case Github)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a Static Site Generator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I emphasize the last bullet because this was a whole new world to me. My first iteration of my site was pure HTML that I had gotten from a template. It got me familiar with basic css stylings and it wasn’t too difficult. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I think my site looked better than the template after a few touch ups. However, I realized that if I were to create another blog post, I would need to copy and paste the blog post template each and every time, then go into that code and change specific portions. And this is where the beauty of a static site generator comes in, where that process is streamlined done given that I have a blog template and some source data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this was supposed to simplify the process… I struggled a lot. You see, the reason why this site didn’t change too much is because I was stubborn. I didn’t want to find a new gatsby template. I wanted my current one! With the help of my pal Anshul, I realized that all I really needed was the css style sheet and I could recreate my old site with gatbsy. Then, I took the ideas from the template and converted them into components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try to not get too specific here because I want to discuss that in my Featured Project section, but I do want to tell you what I’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned a lot about plug-ins and how I need them to create dynamic images/pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned how to make react components to make template creation easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned the basics of graphql and finally figured out how to use localhost/__graphql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the worst/best of it is that I learned how crazy &lt;strong&gt;1 small typo&lt;/strong&gt; can drive you when it doesn’t break your code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I had a lot of fun doing this and I hope to update you all with more projects in the near future!
:) See you guys soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let me tell you something about myself. I absolutely &lt;strong&gt;despise&lt;/strong&gt; interviews. I just find myself freezing up way too much especially at simple questions. I usually walk out of interviews questioning my own qualifications. Now I get it, I’m awful at it because I do not get enough practice interviews. It is exactly that reason which led me to creating this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FAQ section here is supposed to be a list of common interview questions and my answer to them. It’s my way of practicing for interviews and also a way for recruiters to understand the type of person I am and hopefully we can both have a little laugh. To make it more fun and since I’ve wanted to focus on machine learning in general, my plan is to make this section a chat bot so you guys could in “real-time” interview me. More information about this journey will be found in a future blog post.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My First Blog Post]]></title><description><![CDATA[My path so far… So after 7 long long years, I’m finally done with both college and graduate school.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My path so far…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after 7 long long years, I’m finally done with both college and graduate school. I definitely feel more free, although admittedly still stressed about my future employment opportunities, but hey, baby steps! This is why I decided to start this blog; to continue my journey of learning and also have a way to display what I’ve learned and what I’m working on. At the moment it’s built with only html, but I hope to move this to Node.js as I get more familiar with it. If you’re wondering who the adorable cat is in both the top and bottom photo; the top photo is my roommate’s lovely foster cat, Beyonce. The one below is my adorably fat cat, Kiki. I figured that their photos would add a bit more flare to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the plan with the Interview FAQ Section&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering, “what’s going on with the Interview FAQ button?” I have a couple of plans for that actually, but first let me give you some background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you already know, I don’t have that much web development experience. I did go to school for 7 years, so you’d think I would have something to show for it, especially if a good portion of my time spent there was programming. But, let me be honest, while I learned a lot about machine learning algorithms, I didn’t learn enough to apply them. In a way, I learned how to fly before I could run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, in case you can’t already tell by my posts, I’m not good at selling myself, which makes me quite terrible at interviews, which led me to creating the FAQ Section! I wanted to practice my interviews and share my answers to the world! Kinda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, now that I’m done with school, I wanted to explore my own creativity. I want to put what I learned to the test. My long term goal with that section is to create a chatbot to do interviews for me, that way I can apply the machine learning techniques that I’ve learned. My first idea right now is to find a way to map the user input to to my different questions and return the answer mapped to the question. Not that complex, but not bad for a beta version, right?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
