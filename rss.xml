&lt;p&gt;Before I took a hiatus from working on my interview bot, I was trying to create and set up a websocket to integrate the bot as another feature on my site. That process would involved me setting up an websocket API on the backend, hosted on a server somewhere, then I would have had to design the actual react component on my site to make those calls. And I have to say, I was close to completing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had gotten my API set up with Flask, built a working websocket, and had a basic template set up with HTML. Just to show that I’m not lying to you, I’ve attached a photo of the websocket working below. You can also see the branch that I was working on that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rayyungdev/interview-bot/tree/chatapp&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; ChatBot Websocket Working&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;However as I was looking up ways to actually set up the server, I realized that I didn’t have a good FREE choice. I tried serverless and I though about setting up a free E3 instance on AWS, but alas, to no avail. I wasn’t able to set up a serverless instance, because I couldn’t find a working layer to implement the spaCY transformer and the crap free tiered AWS instance with 1GB of ram didn’t seem worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T hen I thought, hmm why don’t I just host it on my own computer? Well, look… I learned enough about websockets to admit that I don’t know enough about them. You see, yes, I can set it up to the point that it’s functional, however, I’m not confident in my own networking skills to secure it. For those of you who don’t know, websockets have a lot of vulnerabliities. And unfortunately, I don’t know enough about those vulnerabilities and how they work to make me feel comfortable with using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… I thought about giving up. I figured, “hey, I have it working, that’s enough… Screw it, whatever” But… here’s the thing, this project wasn’t just a resume boosting project, this was a personal passion project that I want to show people and have them interact with. Not just that, I wanted people to interact with it so that I could continue building a dataset because an interview question dataset just does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me realize something about myself and also a new response to the question, “Tell me about yourself”. I’m a person that comes up with creative solutions. I like thinking outside of the box. I was pidgeon holing myself to only thinking about a react component, a whole webserver. Don’t get me wrong, this would definiltey be the preferred route, but it’s not the only one. You see, a while ago, I had a couple of other project ideas that involved Discord, an extremely popular chat application that was originally built for gamers but has now been purposed for everything from school to work place setups. I was building the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benderbot
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the character from Futurama, this bot was SUPPOSED a bot that acted like the character Bender. I never actually finished the project, but it did interact with people but not in the way I wanted it to.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rayyungdev/tf_benderbot&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rayyungdev/tf_benderbot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Betabot
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bot I built that was meant to help moderate who entered a channel.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was built because I noticed that when people were given access to a server, they could immediately see everyone in the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I kinda finished this bot. Never really used it… but whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link to the repository here:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rayyungdev/betabot&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rayyungdev/betabot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see where I’m going with this? Instead of building a bunch of things from scratch and still have myself vulnerable, why don’t I build a working and interactable bot with Discord? Sure, it would mean that people need a Discord Account, but that’s what all them cool kids have nowadays. And yes, Discord still isn’t necessarily the more secure place, but it’s’ still better than my amatuerish attempt. I feel a lot more confident hosting a discord bot than my own websocket (&lt;em&gt;please train me&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now that I know I’m going to use the Discord API, this now allows me to utilize a whole new set of features that I’m excited about. But that’s going to be a surprised in my next update, which hopefully will be the last! So…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;See you in the next update!&lt;/h2&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Resume Builder]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently, it has come to my attention that I’ve been spending too much time trying to build my chatbot and not enough time on fixing resume…]]></description><link>https://rayyungdev.github.io/blogs/resume-builder/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://rayyungdev.github.io/blogs/resume-builder/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-italic font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; What is it this time...? &lt;hr color=&quot;blue&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto auto auto&quot;&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Recently, it has come to my attention that I’ve been spending too much time trying to build my chatbot and not enough time on fixing resume and applying to jobs. Remember, I got started on these projects so that I would have something to show for on my resume. Now that I have a working website and a working model for my bot (&lt;em&gt;although I haven’t integrated it yet…&lt;/em&gt;), I should really now focus on fixing my resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 Minutes Later…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I have gotten a lot of advice on how to fix my resume to find the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;perfect job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. My current resume (which can be found on my side bar) isn’t particularly outstanding. As my friend Xi has put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 585px; &quot;&gt;
      &lt;a class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-link&quot; href=&quot;/static/952b97b28778ad535ce035fd2b797a7a/52eca/friend.jpg&quot; style=&quot;display: block&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;friend&quot; title=&quot;friend&quot; src=&quot;/static/952b97b28778ad535ce035fd2b797a7a/52eca/friend.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/952b97b28778ad535ce035fd2b797a7a/ff44c/friend.jpg 158w,

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words: &lt;strong&gt;it’s ugly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I was told I should tailor my resume to the different roles I’m going to apply to. So if I’m applying to a web development role, I try to present only my web development projects (&lt;em&gt;which really is just this blog…&lt;/em&gt;). Now upon realizing that I have to create multiple resumes that have only small changes to each one, I find myself being overwhelmed with too many options! Are my previous job experiences more important? Which projects should I prioritize? Recent ones, most relevant ones? There’s just so many. Now how many different resumes am I supposed to create? Ahhhh!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now that I understand the basic aspects of web-development, I wondered why isn’t there something like a static-site-generator for resumes?. All resumes generally have practically the same layout, right? They all have headers, an education section, whatever. All I would then update is the experience sections, right? But… now that I think about it, even it something like that were to exist, it wouldn’t really be tailed to my own experiences…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I’m taking a break from trying to integrate my chatbot to create my own resume building program. I figured, trying to integrate these things is gonna take a bit and I really want to apply to jobs. Also this resume builder shouldn’t take too long since I won’t need to integrate that to my blog. Once it’s done, it’s done. My hope is that it’ll streamline future job applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-italic font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Building the Builder &lt;hr color=&quot;blue&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto auto auto&quot;&gt; &lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like I did with my chatbot, I’m going to think about this in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How am I going to structure my data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This seems more important since I need to know exactly what data I’m pulling and how I might go about that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building the actual program&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well, seems less important at the moment because I at least know what my end result will be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Structuring the Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea for this project is also inspired by what I learned previously about intent classification. While I don’t plan building a learning model for it… &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;, I think a good way to go about this is by tagging my projects and experiences with intents. Speaking of projects and experiences, I’ve been told that experience is more important than personal projects, but relevant projects beat random experience, and relevant experience triumphs over all. Plainly speaking, we have an inherent hierarchy to utilize!&lt;br&gt;
So my plan is this: I’m going to create a csv file where each row represents a project/job that I’ve done. The row is then divided into the following columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End Date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project/Job Title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project or Job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relevant tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company Name (will be empty if it’s a project)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains the details of the project/job
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might separate these details into their own columns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might think about using intent classification in the future to classify the details to the intent (will only work if I have a multitude of descriptors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright… So in hindsight, I think I might’ve oversimplified my solution a bit. After looking at my friend’s resumes, I realized that I completely glossed over other sections, like &lt;em&gt;Skills&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Certificates&lt;/em&gt;(although I have none… oops), and &lt;em&gt;Relevant Coursework&lt;/em&gt;. I forgot that these sections (for the most part), can also be tailored to the job description. This might be the imposter syndrome talking, but I don’t think I’ve developed enough skills to really pick and choose which ones I can throw on there, but hey, I gotta start thinking about future me, right? I am sure future me will be a whole variety of skills for future career aspirations. This is for you Future Ray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let’s do this. I’m going to create a Skills CSV. It will contain the following columns:&lt;br&gt;
Programming Languages, Software &amp;#x26; Tools, Technical Skills, and Certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I find out that I actually have “too many” skills and I might try to create another intent classification model to identify the most relevant skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My friend Trung suggested that I add some of my relevant coursework for my technical skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Building the program&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I have successfully created my program and now I would love to get into some discussion about how I went about this. That being said, I’m going to have to update my recent projects too! Woo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building this application was a fun experience and I’m glad I took the time to think about how I was structuring my data. I ended up having to create 4 different csvs, where each csv contained different information for each subsection in my resume. I could have hard coded some of the basic information like my name and education but I figured maybe someone likes my idea and wants to try it out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to my thought processing when creating this application:&lt;br&gt;
I started this by trying to figure out how to design a resume through Python. There are a lot of options out there, like using a LaTeX template then trying to figure out how to populate the necessary information python, but I figured that was going to get too complicated too quickly, because I thought I would have to manually design a LaTeX template first then find the right libaries to input the correct information. Instead, I opted to use FPDF2, a pdf library for python. I didn’t think the aesthetic appeal mattered that much in regards to my resume, especially since this is my first template. If I focused too much making it perfect, I probably would have called it quits. So thus template_1 was born. You can view my original template layout &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rayyungdev/resume_builder/blob/main/template_1.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I confirmed that my template was completed, I had to make sure that I knew how to input the necessary data, which you can read about in my comments. This is important because the next step was what I called the builder, which is an object class that pulls the necessary the information from the different csvs. I’m not going to go into too much detail because that’s meant for the actual project section. Instead, I’m going to talk about things that I don’t like about my project, future fixes, and unaccomplished objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;Things I don’t like:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate that I have to use 4 different csvs and furtheremore I hate how I laid them out. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad that it works, but it is definitely not the optimal solution. Remember, I plan on using this program in the future as I continue down my career path. This means that every time I learn something, I will have to manually update these microscopic cells in excel. Sure, sure I can create python functions/scripts whatever, but either way I’m still going to hate it. This now lets me segway into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;Future Fixes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So from before, I hate that I have to use 4 different csvs. What I hope to accomplish instead are two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert my csvs into YAML files and create a YAML method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a RESTFUL API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I don’t know too much about YAML, but I just love how YAML files look. They look like they can be more easily organized and most impressively, YAML files can act almost as a pseudo python class or at least I think so from what I can gather from the docs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation#constructors-representers-resolvers&quot;&gt;https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation#constructors-representers-resolvers&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;em&gt;Thank you Andy for suggesting this&lt;/em&gt;). Also, I would just love to have another method to add onto my &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;list of experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Regarding the RESTful API, I feel like this program would really benefit from it. It would allow me to update the different details of my jobs whenever I want, fix typos quickly, and whatever. Plus, I also get to add “designed an API” onto my list of skills too. I’m sure there’s more benefits, but it’s 1:09 AM and I’m tired as hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unaccomplished Objectives:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I think my resume looks pretty decent. However, I haven’t fully implemented my skills section. I’m missing key technologies that I’ve utilized over the years, like frameworks, libraries, toolboxes, etc. This is all the data contained in &lt;em&gt;languages.csv&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t really have a good reason why it hasn’t been included yet… really I’m just tired and I’m moderately satisfied with how my resume looks at the moment. But who knows, I might be more sane when I wake up tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;
Also, I have not built a classification model (&lt;strong&gt;yet&lt;/strong&gt;). Originally, I was thinking about creating a classification model that would pull the most relevant skills according to what your input tags are, but it also had also occured to me that well, I don’t have that many skills to go picking and choosing. That being said, I haven’t given up on this idea, but it does require more thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll add more updates to the actual project section, but as of now, this particular post is hereby concluded :)&lt;br&gt;
Back to trying to integrate the webserver… (and look for jobs)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Resume Builder]]></title><description><![CDATA[Background If you want to learn more about how this project came to be, please check it out here Updates : (8/09/2022) added markdown…]]></description><link>https://rayyungdev.github.io/projects/Resume Builder/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://rayyungdev.github.io/projects/Resume Builder/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updates&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(8/09/2022)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added markdown functionality for details, city, and subheader info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(8/08/2022)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No longer need language.csv. Instead, we can have skill directly added into the experiences.csv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created yaml file and new yaml file builder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combined the two templates instead.. it was unnecessary (may change this later see future updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated main.py to call it from command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(8/02/2022)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a ‘new’ template to my list of resumes. It’s basically the same as the old template, except that there’s an added skill section per project .
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This might mean that I can remove the language.csv file because my new method seemingly has the same intention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might fix up template to have inheritable classes for future templates (maintain consistency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning on first doing some NLP tasks to pull/sort skills that are the most related to the key search terms (Check the github for details)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideas for Myself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues that bug me:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First of all, I’m glad that my application works. However, admittedly, it isn’t exactly working as intended and this might be due to my literal lack of experience. This stems from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;any()&lt;/code&gt; function from python, which is what I’m currently using to pull the experiences that are most related to my tags. This means that it’s currently just pulling any of my experiences that contain at least 1 of my keywords. Instead, I wish it would pull the N-most relatable experiences. At the moment it’s hard to tell given that I don’t have a huge variety of experiences, so that’s limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying Machine Learning Techniques
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I briefly discuss this in my blog post, but I would love to apply some word clustering algorithms into this application, especially now that I’ve attached ‘skills’ to my dataset. For instance, instead of me telling my program to look for specific experiences that use ‘programming’, My key tag is something like ‘software developer’. Instead of looking for exact matches in my tags, it’ll find the tags (and maybe even combination of tags) that software developers generally use. And like what I had originally wanted, it’ll be sorted through rank.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I said check out my github, but basically I think I might have something regarding skill2vec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would also like to apply text generation algorithms that specifically apply to resume building. A friend of mine recently introduced me to something called rezi.ai, a site that uses A.I to build resumes. According to their site, they use the GPT-3, a transformer model, from Open AI, to help formulate details in a resume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, I am officially FINISHED with my first model. There’s a lot of improvements to be made, but let me tell you my process.
First, I had to understand what my goal and objective, but you can read about that in my previous blog post, link [&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;]{&lt;a href=&quot;https://rayyungdev.github.io/blogs/bot-builder/%7D&quot;&gt;https://rayyungdev.github.io/blogs/bot-builder/}&lt;/a&gt;. Once I figured out that I wanted to an intent classification model, I had to learn about how those models were built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I wanted to replicate a paper, that claimed that CBoW-SVM learning model that uses fasttext embeddings. Unfortunately, I was not able to successfully implement that since I couldn’t understand how to implemement CBoW with fasttext. After giving up on that, I found a model through kaggle, that I’ll link &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/code/hassanamin/atis-intent-classification-using-svm-and-spacy/notebook&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, before I tell you about that though, let me tell you about the dataset. Did you know that an interview question dataset that does not exist? Yea! Even though there’s a bunch of interview prep guides out there, an interview question dataset does not yet exist. So I had to build on myself! I went through a couple of interview prep guides, looked through their question and judged their intent. I came out with like 150 questions, with a lot of repetition. Of those 150 questions, I had 30 labeled intentions. I know that’s not a lot of questions, but once I have the bot running I plan on having people use it and also build upon that dataset. It’s not much, but it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the model, the original model from Kaggle uses an SVC model, but I found that I got better results using an SGD model. Of course, this might just be because of how small my dataset it, but yea, please help me build onto this dataset!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I’m getting ahead of myself. The next step now, is to implmement a chatbot that you can use on my site. It’ll probably mean that I have to have a server running somewhere to keep my python model running… but we’ll see when we get there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sneakpeak of my model working:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-italic font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  July 28 2022 Update: &lt;hr color=&quot;blue&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto auto auto&quot;&gt; &lt;/h2&gt; 
I didn&apos;t want to create a whole new post for this update because I haven&apos;t yet accomplished what I wanted to get done. Instead, I wanted to provide some updates on ways I&apos;m looking to integrate my bot to my post.  
&lt;p&gt;But first, let’s establish what I need to get accomplished:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need the script to constantly run on a separate server
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is because I need to set up my specific python environment, like the spaCY NLP encoder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It takes time to start up the bot (around 5 seconds) before you can actually communicate with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out if I need to create a chat interface using Python or Gatsby
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the chat function is built with Gatsby, then I’m constantly pulling data from my python server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the chat funciton is built with Python, then am I just creating an entirely new site with Flask and hosting it on a separate site? Or am I just linking a component…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a way to integrate my bot to my blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe find a way for outside users to help me update my question bank?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This might be where the RESTful API comes in… but eventually I want to continue stockpiling questions for my database so I can further develop my juvenile bot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, I was looking into using a RESTful API with Flask because it seemed simple. It was moments later, as I was reading about RESTful when I discovered that I had no idea what I was even talking about. In case you don’t know : RESTful is a fantastic API to use when you’re just trying to obtaining organized and sorted data.&lt;br&gt;
As the docs from microsoft says: it’s designed around &lt;em&gt;resources&lt;/em&gt;. So for example, this might’ve been feasable if I was creating a way for people to pull specific word for word interview questions and answers. And if I was going to implement so that people can interact with it, then it would be easily overloaded since each message you send to the bot would be another POST request. Basically, it sounds like it sucks trying to get realtime data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, a friend recommended that I look into Web Sockets. However, based on what I’m reading, this is not only more complex but poses more of a security risk. I’m still figuring out the minute details, but this seems like this might be it. Basically, this API is used for real-time applications like video games and chat applications, which is you know… what I’m trying to build!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I’m going to need to look into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I create a Websocket with Python:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.piesocket.com/blog/python-websocket#:~:text=WebSocket%20Client%20with%20Python&amp;#x26;text=Create%20a%20new%20File%20%E2%80%9Cclient,did%20in%20our%20server%20code.&amp;#x26;text=Now%20let&amp;#x27;s%20create%20a%20Python%20asynchronous%20function%20(also%20called%20coroutine).&amp;#x26;text=async%20def%20test()%3A,build%20a%20WebSocket%20client%20connection.&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a quick link&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where should I look to host this websocket?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A friend recommended I look into &lt;a href=&quot;https://serverless.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;serverless&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should I implemenent my websocket with React
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A quick google search gave me this &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/muratcanyuksel/using-websockets-with-react-50pi&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;link&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the risks and how do I minimize it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thank you for reading and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stay tuned for the next update!&lt;/h2&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building the Chatbot Model]]></title><description><![CDATA[The journey started because I suck at interviews.

&lt;p&gt;The journey started because I suck at interviews. I find myself in a spiral of anxiety and imposter syndrome as I continously bomb my interviews.
One weird quirk about me, is that although I feel humiliated, I feel even more motivated now to do something creative so that I can still prove to myself that I am a qualified “developer”.
So anyway, I just bombed an interview and it has reaffirmed my distaste for them. I am now reminded again of something that I originally wanted to do: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;create a chatbot to do the interview for me!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of my idea comes from the believe that interviewers usually ask the same set of questions like, &lt;em&gt;“Tell me about yourself”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“How do you act in high pressure situations”&lt;/em&gt;. There might be variations of this, but they all expect similar responses. So ya know… like &lt;strong&gt;“Frequently Asked Questions”&lt;/strong&gt;. The original plan was going to just have a list of these questions and my answer to them in markdown, like my blogs. But you see, I don’t want to do that because it takes away time from me actually working on the bot that I definitely want to have, so I’m skipping this step. I still have my list of questions and answers, but I’m not going to post it &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-italic font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Getting Started &lt;hr color=&quot;blue&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto auto auto&quot;&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;div class = &apos;font-italic justify-content-center&apos; style=&quot;display:flex&quot;&gt; &lt;small class = &quot;font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; The purpose of this section is to organize my own thoughts on how I plan to go about this project. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I can think about this project as two main parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building the NLP Model for the bot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing a chat feature in my site for users to interact with the bot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for now, let’s think about what building the model will take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out what model I will be using&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather the data to train my model on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I figure out what model I’m going to use, I’ll need to train it.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will involve preprocessing the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally thought I could create my own dataset where I would create my own answers for the FAQ’s, but as I continued to working on it, but that led me down a path to nowhere as I didn’t even have a model in mind. I had to do… &lt;em&gt;research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-italic font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; The Research &lt;hr color=&quot;blue&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto auto auto&quot;&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was first tried looking for an appropriate model, I thought I could use a question-answering model. I figured it was going to be straightforward given the name, that it could be trained if the model was given a enough questions and answers. But alas, this was not the case. It turns out the model is trained to understand contextual questions to identify necessary information in an article, which is not my goal at all… So back to the drawing board!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of going into that direction, I decided to look into how chatbots work. They definitely use some sort of machine learning algorithm, right?  Well I stumbled upon this &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/models-for-conversational-ai-34312fe1f6d9&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; written by Srini Janarthanam. Here, Srini discusses 5 possible Conversational AI classes:   &lt;em&gt;Interactive FAQ, Form Filling, Question Answering, NL interface for Databases, and Dialogue Planning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you catch that? &lt;strong&gt;Interactive FAQ!&lt;/strong&gt; Is this what I needed to look into the whole time? I’ve gotten my hopes up once before, only for it to be torn asunder. So let’s keep reading…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) are usually a common part of business websites where all the frequently asked questions for customers are listed and answered. Instead of having customers go through the list and find answers to their questions, &lt;strong&gt;Interactive FAQ model for chatbots allows users to ask questions in their own way, match customer question to the list of questions and then serve the prepared answer for the matched question.&lt;/strong&gt; This process enables customers to find answers quickly instead of having to go through a long list of questions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/models-for-conversational-ai-34312fe1f6d9&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--- Article by Srini Janarthanam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This… this might be it! Think about it, I’m assuming that different interviewers are asking same question with some variation. While the questions might be diferent, the prepared answer will be the same. &lt;strong&gt;Awesome!&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Srini then discusses models that exist in this field, Single-vs-Multi turn, Intent-vs-Pattern Recognition, User-utterance, and Deeplearning seq2seq models. I’m not going to go through it all because I recommend that you read his article. Instead, I’m going to discuss which models seem the most releveant to my case and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intent-vs-Pattern-Recognition / Intent Classification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea was to train a model by answering a lot of interview questions with the understanding that some answer to these questions are going to be the same, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do you want to work at this company?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Why do you want this job?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer would be the same for both:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I need money and you guys seem awesome”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this model works by mapping &lt;strong&gt;questions with answers&lt;/strong&gt; to an &lt;strong&gt;intent&lt;/strong&gt;. So my previous example would be 1 intent with 2 datapoints (questions) associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the model is to &lt;strong&gt;learn how to classify a new unseen question from a future interviewer as one of the intents&lt;/strong&gt;, as Srini succintly puts it, &lt;em&gt;Once an intent is identified, the answer can be served&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seq2Seq Single-Turn FAQ Model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly I’m not compleltely confident that this model is applicable. seq2seq is a deep learning model and from my understanding of it, it will A LOT of data. You see it a lot with chatbots because the goal of a chatbot is to accept an input as a text and regurgitates a text back. If we want to get into more detail, the sentence is encoded into value, math is done to the value to take context into account, then the calculations are fed into a decoder which is the chatbot’s response. In my case, I don’t really know how I can implement it. And as I’m looking more into seq2seq models, it seems like it requires a large dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m keeping this on here because it might be something I look into later…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/bff6ca93a35d7b0e6ed89f4a817db0eb/spongebob-dance.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; We&apos;re getting somewhere!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-italic font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Gathering Data &lt;hr color=&quot;blue&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto auto auto&quot;&gt;  &lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;div class = &apos;font-italic justify-content-center&apos; style=&quot;display:flex&quot;&gt; &lt;small class = &quot;font-weight-bold&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; In this section, I&apos;m going to look into the specifics of the model so I can create a suitable dataset for it&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I’m pretty set on using intent classification to create my chatbot. So now let’s think about the data. (There won’t be any code for this post, just a lot of brainstorming the code will in my project section because ya know I have to have something there at some point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine that the data would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Intent&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Question&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Why do you want to work at this company?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I need money and you guys seem awesome&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Why do you want this job?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I need money and you guys seem awesome&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Tell me about yourself&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I have a lot of IT experience and I hope to break out in the development world&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Walk me through your resume&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I have a lot of IT experience and I hope to break out in the development world&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now going through all of this, how should I go around gathering my data? So this is probably going to suck because I think going to have to do this manually. Remember, my theory is that there are limited answers to interview questions (&lt;em&gt;unless they ask me techinical questions…&lt;/em&gt;). Once I gather the questions, I’m going to have to group them myself and give each group a unique value that represents intent. Finally, I’ll go through all the intents, pull a random question from it, then finally answer that question. That answer will be my response for the questions in that group. Hopefully, this isn’t going to be that bad.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Gatsby Migration]]></title><description><![CDATA[Background When I first started this projected, I used a bootstrap HTML template from htmlcodex.com.

&lt;p&gt;When I first started this projected, I used a bootstrap HTML template from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://htmlcodex.com/personal-blog-template&quot;&gt;htmlcodex.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; Original HTML template &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see with my blog here, it’s pretty similar. I made some changes to the CSS to make the articles wider and I removed some features/links that I thought was unnecessary, like the “blog detail” and “blog grid”. After I made these adjustments, rayyungdev.github.io v0.0.01 was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Moving to Gatsby &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had no idea how to write javascript, let alone react/gatsby, so it was a bit of a struggle. But I soon understood the pattern between my html template and other codes that I was looking at and the conversion was pretty self explanatory, like changing &lt;strong&gt;HTML’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;react’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div className&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  Again, I’m still new to react and web-development in general so I’m sure I’m not making the most out of gatsby yet, but hey at least I’m starting something, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I still didn’t understand components, plugins, etc, I did know what kind of features I wanted in my site. I knew I wanted to be able to scroll down infinitely on the home page to see my blog history. I also knew that I wanted featured-pictures from my blog posts to populate my homepage. I tried to figure out how to learn all of this by watching a Gatsby Tutorial on youtube that was 9 hours long, but I called it quits after 40 minutes. Don’t get me wrong, it was helpful, but just did not have the patience. Instead, I looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/&quot;&gt;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/&lt;/a&gt; and found the templates that had the features I wanted and tried to implement them the same way, which led me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/&quot;&gt;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had discussed some changes in my blogpost, but given that this is my project section, this is I did specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Components:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navbar
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I removed some things from the original navbar because I just didn’t see the point. I might throw in the page button again, but until I have like 5 posts, I just don’t see it being necessary just yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Pages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is for ongoing projects, but I have 3 different routes that I’m still working on:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specifically for my blog post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specifically for my projects (like this), although I really only put this here so I would have a reason for my banner/carousel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interview
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honestly, not necesarry but this will be changed up later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My goal for this section later is to designate specific templates depending on some things…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div classname=&quot;justify-content-center&quot;&gt;
    Alright, so this is my official SECOND post for my blog. A lot of work has been done and let me tell you all about it!  It might seem like that I haven&apos;t really changed the site at all, but really I have made a whole migration from my old bootstrap html template to a gatsby, a static-site-generator and man was it a pain in the ass. So first... let me tell you why I did this in the first place. I started my blog back in June because of a youtube channel called &quot;Coding with Lewis&quot;. I&apos;m going to attach the video here: 
    &lt;figure align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;70%&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jm5s6N0R0pM&quot; title=&quot;This is the best first project for programmers 👩‍💻 #technology #programming #software #career&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;figcaption align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; The Best First Project for Programmers, Coding with Lewis &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don’t have the patience to watch the 44 second clip, Lewis suggests that the best first programming project should be a blog. Not only that, but he also suggests using the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host the blog for free (in my case Github)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a Static Site Generator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I emphasize the last bullet because this was a whole new world to me. My first iteration of my site was pure HTML that I had gotten from a template. It got me familiar with basic css stylings and it wasn’t too difficult. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I think my site looked better than the template after a few touch ups. However, I realized that if I were to create another blog post, I would need to copy and paste the blog post template each and every time, then go into that code and change specific portions. And this is where the beauty of a static site generator comes in, where that process is streamlined done given that I have a blog template and some source data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this was supposed to simplify the process… I struggled a lot. You see, the reason why this site didn’t change too much is because I was stubborn. I didn’t want to find a new gatsby template. I wanted my current one! With the help of my pal Anshul, I realized that all I really needed was the css style sheet and I could recreate my old site with gatbsy. Then, I took the ideas from the template and converted them into components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try to not get too specific here because I want to discuss that in my Featured Project section, but I do want to tell you what I’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned a lot about plug-ins and how I need them to create dynamic images/pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned how to make react components to make template creation easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned the basics of graphql and finally figured out how to use localhost/__graphql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the worst/best of it is that I learned how crazy &lt;strong&gt;1 small typo&lt;/strong&gt; can drive you when it doesn’t break your code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I had a lot of fun doing this and I hope to update you all with more projects in the near future!
:) See you guys soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let me tell you something about myself. I absolutely &lt;strong&gt;despise&lt;/strong&gt; interviews. I just find myself freezing up way too much especially at simple questions. I usually walk out of interviews questioning my own qualifications. Now I get it, I’m awful at it because I do not get enough practice interviews. It is exactly that reason which led me to creating this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class = &apos;font-weight-bold&apos; align = &apos;Center&apos;&gt; July 28 2022 Update: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably throw this into an actual post instead of updating this here, but if you pressed this button you’re probably wondering if I updated this with something that works. And to answer your question: &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt;. You see, I have a working model that I created using spaCY and sklearn. You can read about that development process here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rayyungdev.github.io/blogs/bot-builder/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bot Builder Follow-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m working on a way to integrate my python script into a chatbot component that you can interact with here…&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My First Blog Post]]></title><description><![CDATA[My path so far… So after 7 long long years, I’m finally done with both college and graduate school.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My path so far…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after 7 long long years, I’m finally done with both college and graduate school. I definitely feel more free, although admittedly still stressed about my future employment opportunities, but hey, baby steps! This is why I decided to start this blog; to continue my journey of learning and also have a way to display what I’ve learned and what I’m working on. At the moment it’s built with only html, but I hope to move this to Node.js as I get more familiar with it. If you’re wondering who the adorable cat is in both the top and bottom photo; the top photo is my roommate’s lovely foster cat, Beyonce. The one below is my adorably fat cat, Kiki. I figured that their photos would add a bit more flare to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the plan with the Interview FAQ Section&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering, “what’s going on with the Interview FAQ button?” I have a couple of plans for that actually, but first let me give you some background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you already know, I don’t have that much web development experience. I did go to school for 7 years, so you’d think I would have something to show for it, especially if a good portion of my time spent there was programming. But, let me be honest, while I learned a lot about machine learning algorithms, I didn’t learn enough to apply them. In a way, I learned how to fly before I could run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, in case you can’t already tell by my posts, I’m not good at selling myself, which makes me quite terrible at interviews, which led me to creating the FAQ Section! I wanted to practice my interviews and share my answers to the world! Kinda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, now that I’m done with school, I wanted to explore my own creativity. I want to put what I learned to the test. My long term goal with that section is to create a chatbot to do interviews for me, that way I can apply the machine learning techniques that I’ve learned. My first idea right now is to find a way to map the user input to to my different questions and return the answer mapped to the question. Not that complex, but not bad for a beta version, right?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
