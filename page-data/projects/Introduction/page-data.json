I made some changes to the CSS to make the articles wider and I removed some features/links that I thought was unnecessary, like the “blog detail” and “blog grid”. After I made these adjustments, rayyungdev.github.io v0.0.01 was born.</p>\n<h1 align=\"center\"> Moving to Gatsby </h1>\n<p>At this point, I had no idea how to write javascript, let alone react/gatsby, so it was a bit of a struggle. But I soon understood the pattern between my html template and other codes that I was looking at and the conversion was pretty self explanatory, like changing <strong>HTML’s</strong> <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;div class></code> to <strong>react’s</strong> <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;div className></code>.  Again, I’m still new to react and web-development in general so I’m sure I’m not making the most out of gatsby yet, but hey at least I’m starting something, right?</p>\n<p>While I still didn’t understand components, plugins, etc, I did know what kind of features I wanted in my site. I knew I wanted to be able to scroll down infinitely on the home page to see my blog history. I also knew that I wanted featured-pictures from my blog posts to populate my homepage. I tried to figure out how to learn all of this by watching a Gatsby Tutorial on youtube that was 9 hours long, but I called it quits after 40 minutes. Don’t get me wrong, it was helpful, but just did not have the patience. Instead, I looked at <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/\">https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/</a> and found the templates that had the features I wanted and tried to implement them the same way, which led me to <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/\">https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What were the Changes</strong></p>\n<p>I had discussed some changes in my blogpost, but given that this is my project section, this is I did specifically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Components:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Header</li>\n<li>Navbar\n<ul>\n<li>I removed some things from the original navbar because I just didn’t see the point. I might throw in the page button again, but until I have like 5 posts, I just don’t see it being necessary just yet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Sidebar</li>\n<li>Layout</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>New Pages:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This is for ongoing projects, but I have 3 different routes that I’m still working on:\n<ul>\n<li>Blogs\n<ul>\n<li>specifically for my blog post</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Projects\n<ul>\n<li>specifically for my projects (like this), although I really only put this here so I would have a reason for my banner/carousel</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Interview\n<ul>\n<li>Honestly, not necesarry but this will be changed up later</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>My goal for this section later is to designate specific templates depending on some things…</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Great Gatsby Migration","date":"July 07, 2022","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogs/second-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"MVP Gatsby Website Finally Complete!"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"d34d284e-6d5f-5669-a4ec-73062f007d42","previousPostId":"95089288-5413-5646-b5b3-d890dd279e9b","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3295556198"]}
