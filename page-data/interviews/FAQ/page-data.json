I just find myself freezing up way too much especially at simple questions. I usually walk out of interviews questioning my own qualifications. Now I get it, I’m awful at it because I do not get enough practice interviews. It is exactly that reason which led me to creating this section.</p>\n<p>The FAQ section here is supposed to be a list of common interview questions and my answer to them. It’s my way of practicing for interviews and also a way for recruiters to understand the type of person I am and hopefully we can both have a little laugh. To make it more fun and since I’ve wanted to focus on machine learning in general, my plan is to make this section a chat bot so you guys could in “real-time” interview me. More information about this journey will be found in a future blog post.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Interview FAQ","date":"July 05, 2022","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogs/my-first-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My First Blog Post"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogs/gatsby-migration/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"MVP Gatsby Website Finally Complete!"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"45978cc7-3947-5fa4-b247-069a496d38fc","previousPostId":"b963260c-f121-5a61-ba38-2ce25d0fefd0","nextPostId":"82fb88e6-fb75-59b9-9edb-5c7b406ab096"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3295556198"]}
