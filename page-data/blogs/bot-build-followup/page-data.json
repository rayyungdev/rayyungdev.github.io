There’s a lot of improvements to be made, but let me tell you my process.\r\nFirst, I had to understand what my goal and objective, but you can read about that in my previous blog post, link [<em>here</em>]{<a href=\"https://rayyungdev.github.io/blogs/bot-builder/%7D\">https://rayyungdev.github.io/blogs/bot-builder/}</a>. Once I figured out that I wanted to an intent classification model, I had to learn about how those models were built.</p>\n<p>Originally I wanted to replicate a paper, that claimed that CBoW-SVM learning model that uses fasttext embeddings. Unfortunately, I was not able to successfully implement that since I couldn’t understand how to implemement CBoW with fasttext. After giving up on that, I found a model through kaggle, that I’ll link <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/code/hassanamin/atis-intent-classification-using-svm-and-spacy/notebook\"><em>here</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Alright, before I tell you about that though, let me tell you about the dataset. Did you know that an interview question dataset that does not exist? Yea! Even though there’s a bunch of interview prep guides out there, an interview question dataset does not yet exist. So I had to build on myself! I went through a couple of interview prep guides, looked through their question and judged their intent. I came out with like 150 questions, with a lot of repetition. Of those 150 questions, I had 30 labeled intentions. I know that’s not a lot of questions, but once I have the bot running I plan on having people use it and also build upon that dataset. It’s not much, but it’s a start.</p>\n<p>Going back to the model, the original model from Kaggle uses an SVC model, but I found that I got better results using an SGD model. Of course, this might just be because of how small my dataset it, but yea, please help me build onto this dataset!</p>\n<p>Actually, I’m getting ahead of myself. The next step now, is to implmement a chatbot that you can use on my site. It’ll probably mean that I have to have a server running somewhere to keep my python model running… but we’ll see when we get there!</p>\n<p>Here’s a sneakpeak of my model working:</p>\n<figure align=\"center\">\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e648bb8fcd62d1fe6e5472449b4f77e3/491c4/chatbot%20sneakpeak.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 23.417721518987342%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"chatbot sneakpeak\" title=\"chatbot sneakpeak\" src=\"/static/e648bb8fcd62d1fe6e5472449b4f77e3/828fb/chatbot%20sneakpeak.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/e648bb8fcd62d1fe6e5472449b4f77e3/ff44c/chatbot%20sneakpeak.jpg 158w,\n/static/e648bb8fcd62d1fe6e5472449b4f77e3/a6688/chatbot%20sneakpeak.jpg 315w,\n/static/e648bb8fcd62d1fe6e5472449b4f77e3/828fb/chatbot%20sneakpeak.jpg 630w,\n/static/e648bb8fcd62d1fe6e5472449b4f77e3/0ede0/chatbot%20sneakpeak.jpg 945w,\n/static/e648bb8fcd62d1fe6e5472449b4f77e3/3ac88/chatbot%20sneakpeak.jpg 1260w,\n/static/e648bb8fcd62d1fe6e5472449b4f77e3/491c4/chatbot%20sneakpeak.jpg 1514w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<figcaption align=\"center\"><b> Chatbot Sneakpeak</b> </figcaption></figure>  \n<h2>Stay tune for the next update!</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Chatbot Model Complete","date":"July 14, 2022","description":"Build-a-Bot Follow Up"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogs/bot-builder/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building the Chatbot Model"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"dcfe7019-2482-5937-ad90-40ca3a5a6892","previousPostId":"3d06946a-995b-5c62-9c03-c7e24a6914b4","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3295556198"]}
