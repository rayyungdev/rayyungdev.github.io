I got the bot to work. I linked it to discord! And now you guys can try it out! I’m not going to talk too much about it here, instead I’ll create a project discussion post later. That being said, implementing the bot in Discord turned out to have a lot of benefits. For instance, I can create different commands that can be understood by my bot before processing it unnecessarily through my pipeline.</p>\n<p>As of 8/18/2022, I have also implemented a React Web-app that is linked into my blog instead. The Discord server is still active, but I wanted to also explore new React Functionality. This was a longer process, but it was fun. I’m still working on it to make it look nicer and try to also implement commands. This is especially important because I cannot currently update the list of misclassified values. I might even look into different ways to host my Flask server.</p>\n<p>Anyway, check it out!</p>\n<h2>See you in the next update!</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Chatbot - Final","date":"August 22, 2022","description":"Here I discuss what changes I made to chatbot, the different implementations and future ideas"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blogs/bot-build-penultimate/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Chatbot - Penultimate"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/Interview Bot/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Chat Bot"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6280408c-d1d3-5f74-8ef4-2710d93d9057","previousPostId":"cdb19042-66da-514e-85aa-3ffcdb016d1d","nextPostId":"ad7ad18d-4270-5f10-9fb2-2ecc6e34165e"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3295556198"]}
