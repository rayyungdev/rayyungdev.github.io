A lot of work has been done and let me tell you all about it!  It might seem like that I haven't really changed the site at all, but really I have made a whole migration from my old bootstrap html template to a gatsby, a static-site-generator and man was it a pain in the ass. So first... let me tell you why I did this in the first place. I started my blog back in June because of a youtube channel called \"Coding with Lewis\". I'm going to attach the video here: \n    <figure align=\"center\">\n    <iframe width=\"30%\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jm5s6N0R0pM\" title=\"This is the best first project for programmers 👩‍💻 #technology #programming #software #career\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<figcaption align=\"center\"><b> The Best First Project for Programmaers, Coding with Lewis </b> </figcaption></figure></div>\n</figure>\n<p>In case you don’t have the patience to watch the 44 second clip, Lewis suggests that the best first programing project should be a blog. Not only that, but he also suggests using the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use a template</li>\n<li>Host the blog for free (in my case Github)</li>\n<li><em><strong>Use a Static Site Generator</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I emphasize the last bullet because this was a whole new world to me. My first iteration of my site was pure HTML that I had gotten from a template. It got me familiar with basic css stylings and it wasn’t too difficult. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I think my site looked better than the template after a few touch ups. However, I realized that if I were to create another blog post, I would need to copy and paste the blog post template each and every time, then go into that code and change specific portions. And this is where the beauty of a static site generator comes in, where that process is streamlined done given that I have a blog template and some source data.</p>\n<p>While this was supposed to simplify the process… I struggled a lot. You see, the reason why this site didn’t change too much is because I was stubborn. I didn’t want to find a new gatsby template. I wanted my current one! With the help of my pal Anshul, I realized that all I really needed was the css style sheet and I could recreate my old site with gatbsy. Then, I took the ideas from the template and converted them into components.</p>\n<p>I’m going to try to not get too specific here because I want to discuss that in my Featured Project section, but I do want to tell you what I’ve learned.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I learned a lot about plug-ins and how I need them to create dynamic images/pages</li>\n<li>I learned how to make react components to make template creation easier.</li>\n<li>I learned the basics of graphql and finally figured out how to use localhost/__graphql</li>\n<li>And the worst/best of it is that I learned how crazy <strong>1 small typo</strong> can drive you when it doesn’t break your code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, I had a lot of fun doing this and I hope to update you all with more projects in the near future!\r\n:) See you guys soon.</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"MVP Gatsby Website Finally Complete!","date":"July 06, 2022","description":"This is my official SECOND post for my blog, along with a completion of my first major personal project, which is this working website!
