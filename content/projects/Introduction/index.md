**What were the Changes**

I had discussed some changes in my blogpost, but given that this is my project section, this is I did specifically:   

1. **Components:**
    - Header
    - Navbar
        - I removed some things from the original navbar because I just didn't see the point. I might throw in the page button again, but until I have like 5 posts, I just don't see it being necessary just yet. 
    - Sidebar
    - Layout  
  
2. **New Pages:**
    - This is for ongoing projects, but I have 3 different routes that I'm still working on: 
        - Blogs
            - specifically for my blog post
        - Projects
            - specifically for my projects (like this), although I really only put this here so I would have a reason for my banner/carousel
        - Interview
            - Honestly, not necesarry but this will be changed up later
    - My goal for this section later is to designate specific templates depending on some things....
