Alright, I have done it! I got the bot to work. I linked it to discord! And now you guys can try it out! I'm not going to talk too much about it here, instead I'll create a project discussion post later. That being said, implementing the bot in Discord turned out to have a lot of benefits. For instance, I can create different commands that can be understood by my bot before processing it unnecessarily through my pipeline. 

As of 8/18/2022, I have also implemented a React Web-app that is linked into my blog instead. The Discord server is still active, but I wanted to also explore new React Functionality. This was a longer process, but it was fun. I'm still working on it to make it look nicer and try to also implement commands. This is especially important because I cannot currently update the list of misclassified values. I might even look into different ways to host my Flask server. 

Anyway, check it out! 

## See you in the next update!
