Alright, I have done it! I got the bot to work. I linked it to discord! And now you guys can try it out! I'm not going to talk too much about it here, instead I'll create a project discussion post later. That being said, implementing the bot in Discord turned out to have a lot of benefits. For instance, I can utilize different commands!  

Anyway! The discord invite to my server is now the button! Go check it out!

## See you in the next update!
