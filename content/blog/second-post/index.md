    Alright, so this is my official SECOND post for my blog. A lot of work has been done and let me tell you all about it!  It might seem like that I haven't really changed the site at all, but really I have made a whole migration from my old bootstrap html template to a gatsby, a static-site-generator and man was it a pain in the ass. So first... let me tell you why I did this in the first place. I started my blog back in June because of a youtube channel called "Coding with Lewis". I'm going to attach the video here: 
    <figure align = "center">
    <iframe width="70%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jm5s6N0R0pM" title="This is the best first project for programmers 👩‍💻 #technology #programming #software #career" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In case you don't have the patience to watch the 44 second clip, Lewis suggests that the best first programming project should be a blog. Not only that, but he also suggests using the following: 
  1. Use a template  
  2. Host the blog for free (in my case Github)  
  3. ***Use a Static Site Generator***  

I emphasize the last bullet because this was a whole new world to me. My first iteration of my site was pure HTML that I had gotten from a template. It got me familiar with basic css stylings and it wasn't too difficult. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I think my site looked better than the template after a few touch ups. However, I realized that if I were to create another blog post, I would need to copy and paste the blog post template each and every time, then go into that code and change specific portions. And this is where the beauty of a static site generator comes in, where that process is streamlined done given that I have a blog template and some source data.  

While this was supposed to simplify the process... I struggled a lot. You see, the reason why this site didn't change too much is because I was stubborn. I didn't want to find a new gatsby template. I wanted my current one! With the help of my pal Anshul, I realized that all I really needed was the css style sheet and I could recreate my old site with gatbsy. Then, I took the ideas from the template and converted them into components. 

I'm going to try to not get too specific here because I want to discuss that in my Featured Project section, but I do want to tell you what I've learned. 
- I learned a lot about plug-ins and how I need them to create dynamic images/pages
- I learned how to make react components to make template creation easier. 
- I learned the basics of graphql and finally figured out how to use localhost/__graphql
- And the worst/best of it is that I learned how crazy **1 small typo** can drive you when it doesn't break your code. 

Anyway, I had a lot of fun doing this and I hope to update you all with more projects in the near future!
:) See you guys soon.
