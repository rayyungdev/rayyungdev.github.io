<h2 class = 'font-weight-bold' align = 'Center'> What is this section? </h2>

So, let me tell you something about myself. I absolutely **despise** interviews. I just find myself freezing up way too much especially at simple questions. I usually walk out of interviews questioning my own qualifications. Now I get it, I'm awful at it because I do not get enough practice interviews. It is exactly that reason which led me to creating this section.

I should probably throw this into an actual post instead of updating this here, but if you pressed this button you're probably wondering if I updated this with something that works. And to answer your question: _kinda_. You see, I have a working model that I created using spaCY and sklearn. You can read about that development process here:

Right now I'm working on a way to integrate my python script into a chatbot component that you can interact with here...
