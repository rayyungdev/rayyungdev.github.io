<h2 class = 'font-weight-bold' align = 'Center'> What is this section? </h2>

So, let me tell you something about myself. I absolutely **despise** interviews. I just find myself freezing up way too much especially at simple questions. I usually walk out of interviews questioning my own qualifications. Now I get it, I'm awful at it because I do not get enough practice interviews. It is exactly that reason which led me to creating this section.   
   
The FAQ section here is supposed to be a list of common interview questions and my answer to them. It's my way of practicing for interviews and also a way for recruiters to understand the type of person I am and hopefully we can both have a little laugh. To make it more fun and since I've wanted to focus on machine learning in general, my plan is to make this section a chat bot so you guys could in "real-time" interview me. More information about this journey will be found in a future blog post.
