I graduated Drexel University with both my Masters and Bachelors in Electrical Engineering. Despite what my degree suggests, my hope is to pursue a career in Software Development and Data Engineering. In fact, the reason why I even pursued my masters in Electrical Engineering was so that I could learn more about machine learning! Because of this, I have a lot of experience with both Python and Matlab. \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p className=\"m-2\">\r\n                            I created this blog as a means of furthering my own software development skills.
